# Introduction
WPF UI is a library designed for building modern user interfaces in a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) environment.  
By default, the library is created for `.NET 6`. If you want to know more about .NET 6, [have a look here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6).

### ðŸš€ Getting started
Before you start playing around with WPF UI, we recommend that you familiarize yourself [with the WPF basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/get-started/create-app-visual-studio?view=netdesktop-6.0).  
When you know more or less what and how, [see our tutorial](https://wpfui.lepo.co/documentation/tutorial).
